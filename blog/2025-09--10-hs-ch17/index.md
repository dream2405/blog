In this final chapter we show how the reasoning techniques introduced in the previous chapter can be used to calculate compilers. We start by showing how a semantics for a language can be transformed into a compiler in a series of steps, and then show how the steps can be combined to allow a compiler to be calculated directly from a statement of its correctness.

## Introduction

The ability to calculate compilers has been a key objective in the field of program transformation since its earliest days. Starting from a high-level semantics for a source language, the aim is to transform the semantics into a compiler that translates source programs into a lower-level target language, together with a virtual machine that executes the resulting target programs.

There are two main advantages of such an approach. Firstly, the compiler, target language and virtual machine are **systematically derived** during the transformation process, rather than having to be manually defined by the user. And secondly, the resulting compiler and virtual machine do not usually require subsequent proofs of correctness, as they are **correct by construction**.

In chapter 16 we presented a compiler for arithmetic expressions, and proved its correctness. In this chapter we show how the compiler can be calculated directly from a statement of its correctness. We develop our approach in two stages, first introducing the basic ideas using a series of transformation steps, and then showing how the separate steps can be combined into a single step. For simplicity, we restrict our attention to arithmetic expressions, but the same techniques can also be used to calculate compilers for more sophisticated languages.

## Syntax and semantics

We start in the same manner as the compiler correctness example from the previous chapter, with two definitions that respectively capture the syntax (form) and semantics (meaning) of a simple language of arithmetic expressions built up from integer values using an addition operator:

```haskell
data Expr = Val Int | Add Expr Expr

eval :: Expr -> Int
eval (Val n) = n
eval (Add x y) = eval x + eval y
```

For example, the expression $1 + 2$ can be evaluated as follows:

```haskell
  eval (Add (Val 1) (Val 2))
= { applying eval }
  eval (Val 1) + eval (Val 2)
= { applying the first eval }
  1 + eval (Val 2)
= { applying eval }
  1 + 2
= { applying + }
  3
```

We now show how to calculate a compiler based on this semantics using a series of three transformation steps. The first two steps generalise the evaluation function, and the final step simplifies the resulting definitions.

## Adding a stack

The first step is to transform the evaluation function `eval` into a version that utilises a stack, in order to make the manipulation of argument values explicit. In particular, rather than returning a single value of type `Int`, we seek to define a more general evaluation function, `eval'`, that takes a stack of integers as an additional argument, and returns a modified stack given by pushing the value of the expression onto the top of the stack. More precisely, if we represent a stack as a list of integers (where the head is the top element)

```haskell
type Stack = [Int]
```

then we seek to define a function

```haskell
eval' :: Expr -> Stack -> Stack
```

with the following property:

```haskell
eval' e s = eval e : s
```

Rather than first defining `eval'` and then proving by induction on the expression `e` that it satisfies the above equation, we use the technique introduced in the previous chapter and calculate a definition for `eval'` that satisfies this equation, using the desire to apply the induction hypotheses as the driving force for the calculation process. In the base case, `Val n`, the calculation is easy:

```haskell
  eval' (Val n) s
= { specification of eval' }
  eval (Val n) : s
= { applying eval }
  n : s
= { define: push n s = n : s }
  push n s
```

Note that in the final step we defined an auxiliary function, `push`, that captures the idea of pushing a number onto the stack. With the above calculation, we have discovered the definition of `eval'` for expressions of the form `Val n`:

```haskell
eval' (Val n) s = push n s
```

In the inductive case, `Add x y`, we proceed as follows:

```haskell
  eval' (Add x y) s
= { specification of eval' }
  eval (Add x y) : s
= { applying eval }
  (eval x + eval y) : s
```

Now we appear to be stuck, as no further definitions can be applied. However, as we are performing an inductive calculation, we can make use of the induction hypotheses for the two argument expressions `x` and `y`, namely:

- `eval' x s'` $=$ `eval x : s'`
- `eval' y s'` $=$ `eval y : s'`

In order to use these hypotheses, it is clear that we must push the values `eval x` and `eval y` onto the stack, which can readily be achieved by introducing another auxiliary function, `add`, that captures the idea of adding the top two numbers on the stack. The remainder of the calculation is then straightforward:

```haskell
  (eval x + eval y) : s
= { define: add (m : n : s) = n+m : s }
  add (eval y : eval x : s)
= { induction hypothesis for x }
  add (eval y : eval' x s)
= { induction hypothesis for y }
  add (eval' y (eval' x s))
```
â–¡

Note that pushing `eval x` onto the stack before `eval y` above corresponds to addition evaluating its arguments from left-to-right. It would be perfectly valid to push the values in the opposite order, which would correspond to right-to-left evaluation. 

In conclusion, we have calculated the following definition

```haskell
eval' :: Expr -> Stack -> Stack
eval' (Val n)   s = push n s
eval' (Add x y) s = add (eval' y (eval' x s))
```

where:

```haskell
push :: Int -> Stack -> Stack
push n s = n : s

add :: Stack -> Stack
add (m : n : s) = n+m : s
```

Finally, our original evaluation function `eval` can now be recovered from our new function by substituting the empty stack `s` $=$ `[]` into the equation `eval' e s` $=$ `eval e : s` from which `eval'` was constructed, and selecting the unique value in the resulting singleton stack using the function `head`:

```haskell
eval :: Expr -> Int
eval e = head (eval' e [])
```

For example, using this new definition evaluation of $1+2$ now proceeds by pushing the two values onto the stack prior adding them together:

```haskell
  eval (Add (Val 1) (Val 2))
= { applying eval }
  head (eval' (Add (Val 1) (Val 2)) [])
= { applying eval' }
  head (add (eval' (Val 2) (eval' (Val 1) [])))
= { applying the inner eval' }
  head (add (eval' (Val 2) (push 1 [])))
= { applying eval' }
  head (add (push 2 (push 1 [])))
= { applying push }
  head (add (2 : 1 : []))
= { applying add }
  head (3 : [])
= { applying head }
  3
```

## Adding a continuation

The next step is to transform the stack-based evaluation function `eval'` into **continuation-passing style**, in order to make the flow of control explicit. In particular, we seek to define a more general evaluation function, `eval''`, that takes a function from stacks to stacks (the continuation) as an additional argument, which is used to process the stack that results from evaluating the expression. 

More precisely, if we define a type for continuations

```haskell
type Cont = Stack -> Stack
```

then we seek to define a function

```haskell
eval'' :: Expr -> Cont -> Cont
```

such that:

```haskell
eval'' e c s = c (eval' e s)
```

We calculate the definition for `eval''` directly from this equation by induction on the expression `e`. The base case is once again easy,

```haskell
  eval'' (Val n) c s
= { specification of eval'' }
  c (eval' (Val n) s)
= { applying eval' }
  c (push n s)
```

while for the inductive case we calculate as follows:

```haskell
  eval'' (Add x y) c s
= { specification of eval'' }
  c (eval' (Add x y) s)
= { applying eval' }
  c (add (eval' y (eval' x s)))
= { unapplying . }
  (c . add) (eval' y (eval' x s))
= { induction hypothesis for y }
  eval'' y (c . add) (eval' x s)
= { induction hypothesis for x }
  eval'' x (eval'' y (c . add)) s
```

In conclusion, we have calculated the following definition:

```haskell
eval'' :: Expr -> Cont -> Cont
eval'' (Val n)   c s = c (push n s)
eval'' (Add x y) c s = eval'' x (eval'' y (c . add)) s
```

Our previous evaluation function `eval'` can now be recovered by substituting the identity continuation `c` $=$ `id` into the equation `eval'' e c s` $=$ `c (eval' e s)` from which the function `eval''` was constructed:

```haskell
eval' :: Expr -> Cont
eval' e s = eval'' e id s
```

For example, evaluation of $1 + 2$ now proceeds by transferring control to evaluation of the second argument once evaluation of the first has completed:

```haskell
  eval' (Add (Val 1) (Val 2)) []
= { applying eval' }
  eval'' (Add (Val 1) (Val 2)) id []
= { applying eval'' }
  eval'' (Val 1) (eval'' (Val 2) (id . add)) []
= { applying the outer eval'' }
  eval'' (Val 2) (id . add) (push 1 [])
= { applying eval'' }
  (id . add) (push 2 (push 1 []))
= { applying . }
  id (add (push 2 (push 1 [])))
= { applying push }
  id (add (2 : 1 : []))
= { applying add }
  id [3]
= { applying id }
  [3]
```

## Defunctionalising

The third and final step is to transform the evaluation function back into first-order style, using **defunctionalisation**. In particular, rather than using functions of type `Cont` $=$ `Stack -> Stack` for continuations passed as arguments and returned as results, we define a new type that represents the specific forms of continuations that we actually need for our evaluation function.

Within the definitions for `eval'` and `eval''`, there are only three forms of continuations that are used, namely one to halt the evaluation process, one to push a number onto the top of the stack, and one to add the top two numbers on the stack. We begin by separating out these three forms, by giving them names and passing their variables as parameters. That is, we define three **combinators** for constructing the required forms of continuations:

```haskell
haltC :: Cont
haltC = id

pushC :: Int -> Cont -> Cont
pushC n c = c . push n

addC :: Cont -> Cont
addC c = c . add
```

Using these combinators, our evaluators can now be rewritten as follows:

```haskell
eval' :: Expr -> Cont
eval' e = eval'' e haltC

eval'' :: Expr -> Cont -> Cont
eval'' (Val n)   c = pushC n c
eval'' (Add x y) c = eval'' x (eval'' y (addC c))
```

It is easy to check by expanding definitions that these are equivalent to the previous versions. The next stage in applying defunctionalisation is to define a new type, `Code`, whose constructors represent the three combinators:

```haskell
data Code = HALT | PUSH Int Code | ADD Code
    deriving Show
```

The constructors of this type have the same types as the corresponding combinators, except that the new type `Code` now plays the role of `Cont`:

```haskell
HALT :: Code
PUSH :: Int -> Code -> Code
ADD  :: Code -> Code
```

The name `Code` for the type reflects the fact that its values represent code for a virtual machine that evaluates expressions using a stack. For example, the code `PUSH 1 (PUSH 2 (ADD HALT))` corresponds to the expression $1 + 2$. The fact that values of type `Code` represent continuations of type `Cont` is formalised by defining a function that maps from one to the other:

```haskell
exec :: Code -> Cont
exec HALT       = haltC
exec (PUSH n c) = pushC n (exec c)
exec (ADD c)    = addC (exec c)
```

In turn, we then simplify the definition for `exec` by expanding out the definitions for the type `Cont` and its three combinators.

`HALT` case:
```haskell
  exec HALT s
= { applying exec }
  haltC s
= { applying haltC }
  id s
= { applying id }
  s
```

`PUSH` case:
```haskell
  exec (PUSH n c) s
= { applying exec }
  pushC n (exec c) s
= { applying pushC }
  (exec c . push n) s
= { applying . }
  exec c (push n s)
= { applying push }
  exec c (n : s)
```

`ADD` case:
```haskell
  exec (ADD c) s
= { applying exec }
  addC (exec c) s
= { applying addC }
  (exec c . add) s
= { applying . }
  exec c (add s)
= { assume s of the form m : n : s' }
  exec c (add (m : n : s'))
= { applying add }
  exec c (n+m : s')
```

In conclusion, we have calculated the following definition:

```haskell
exec :: Code -> Stack -> Stack
exec HALT s = s
exec (PUSH n c) s = exec c (n : s)
exec (ADD c) (m : n : s) = exec c (n+m : s)
```

That is, `exec` is a function that executes code using an initial stack to give a final stack. In other words, `exec` is a virtual machine for executing code. 

Finally, defunctionalisation itself now proceeds by simply replacing occurrences of the combinations `haltC`, `pushC` and `addC` in the evaluation functions `eval'` and `eval''` by their respective counterparts `HALT`, `PUSH` and `ADD` from the type `Code`, which results in the following two new definitions:

```haskell
comp :: Expr -> Code
comp e = comp' e HALT

comp' :: Expr -> Code -> Code
comp' (Val n)   c = PUSH n c
comp' (Add x y) c = comp' x (comp' y (ADD c))
```

That is, we have now derived a function `comp` that compiles an expression to code, which is itself defined in terms of an auxiliary function `comp'` that takes additional code as an extra argument. This is essentially the same compiler that we developed in the previous chapter, except that all the required compilation machinery â€” compiler, target language and virtual machine â€” has now been systematically derived from a semantics for the source language using equational reasoning. 

The only difference is that rather than representing code as a list, we now have a dedicated recursive type for code. For example, `[PUSH 1, PUSH 2, ADD]` is now written as `PUSH 1 (PUSH 2 (ADD HALT))`.

The correctness of the compilation functions `comp` and `comp'` is captured by the following two equations, which are consequences of defunctionalisation, or can be verified by simple inductive proofs on the expression argument:

- `exec (comp e) s` $=$ `eval' e s`
- `exec (comp' e c) s` $=$ `eval'' e (exec c) s`

Expanding the right-hand sides of these equations using the original specifications for the functions `eval'` and `eval''`, we obtain the same compiler correctness equations that were used in the previous chapter:

- `exec (comp e) s` $=$ `eval e : s`
- `exec (comp' e c) s` $=$ `exec c (eval e : s)`
